# Catch Point

- Catch Point is a website and web-application performance monitoring tool
- With Catch Point we can measure, monitor and analyze the performance of website, web-based application or servers
- We can configure and perform tests as we desire. Below are some types of tests.
	- Web Test Type
	- Transaction Test Type
	- HTML Test Type
	- API Test Type
	- WebSocket Test Type
	- Streaming Test Type
	- DNS Test Type
	- FTP Test Type
	- TCP Test Type
	- SMTP Test Type
	- Ping Test Type
	- Traceroute Test Type
	- SSH Test Type

* ***Web Test Type***
```
The Catchpoint Web test offers crucial insight to the performance of your webpage. The test examines a single
webpage where you are able to customize how that webpage is investigated by choosing the type of monitor, in-
-cluding additional elements to the HTTP request header, and defining advanced settings. Additionally, you can
override the default values set up at the Product and Folder level for targeting, scheduling, authentication, 
HTTP requests, Insight collection and alerts.
```

* ***Transaction Test Type***
```
Catchpoint allows you to use the Selenium language to record transactions then copy and paste the result into
a Test Monitor to run on a periodic basis. Selenium is primarily for automating web applications and testing.
Catchpoint lets you use the power of Selenium to create customized Test Monitors with minimal effort.
```

* ***HTML Code Test Type***
```
An HTML Code test examines HTML code without first requesting it from the server. This allows you to input your
HTML directly in Catchpoint so that you can test how it performs in a test environment. Creating a test involv-
-es defining what you want Catchpoint to test and how you want the test to behave. Additionally, you can overr-
-ide the default values set up at the Product and Folder level for targeting, scheduling, Insight collection 
and alerts.
```

* ***API Test Type***
```
Both API monitoring tests and Web Transaction tests use the Selenium scripting language and multi-step tests,
as well as custom Catchpoint actions, assertions, and macros. API test transactions, however, access URLs then
parse their XML or JSON responses before completing the next step in the test. There is no HTML to render, no
Javascript to execute, and no CSS.
```

* ***WebSocket Test Type***
```
Often used in chats, financial tickers, and gaming applications, WebSockets allow for simultaneous real-time
communication between client and server through a single persistent connection. With the WebSocket Test you
can monitor WebSockets by establishing a connection, sending data, asserting the server response, and creat-
-ing custom metrics based on the response.
```

* ***Streaming Test Type***
```
The Streaming test uses an open source video player that is embedded into the Chrome browser. This is used
by the test agent to control the video and play the stream while simultaneously capturing the performance
metrics. The Streaming monitor can capture HTTP headers, Meta data and a screenshot on failures or at all times.  

Streaming is only available to the OnPrem network type. Additionally, Enable Ping, Debug Primary Host, Enable
ICMP Ping and Enable Data Push Api are also options for streaming tests. 

Catchpoint Streaming tests playback for a fixed length of 15 seconds with a test timeout of 30 seconds.
```

* ***DNS Test Type***
```
The DNS test allows you to monitor the performance and availability of your DNS nameservers. Catchpoint allows
you to directly monitor each nameserver, or you can monitor any of the authoritative nameservers of a domain by
emulating a recursive DNS resolver that does not cache records. 
```

* ***FTP Test Type***
```
An FTP test monitors the performance and availability of files on an FTP server. The FTP test can retrieve inf-
-ormation about a file or test and whether the file can be uploaded or downloaded on the FTP server. Creating a
test involves defining whether Catchpoint should use Authentication, the type of request Catchpoint should make
and test and the test should behave when there is a failure.
```

* ***TCP Test Type***
```
The TCP test monitors the performance and availability of a connection to a given host and port using the TCP
protocol. Creating a test involves defining the host and port you want Catchpoint to test, and the request data
you want Catchpoint to send.
```

* ***SMTP Test Type***
```
The SMTP test monitors mail servers with the ability to send test emails. 
```

* ***Ping Test Type***
```
The Ping test provides metrics related to round trip time (RTT) and packet loss to a specified server. The ping
sends five packets of roughly 64 bytes each.
```

* ***Traceroute Test Type***
```
The Traceroute test runs in standard or Paris mode to analyze traffic routing. The test sends three packets per
hop; each packet totals roughly 64 bytes in size.
```

* ***SSH Test Type***
```
The SSH test allows issuing Shell commands to a specified server.
```
